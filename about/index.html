                <p>Hello, I am Kaloyan, a student from Bulgaria. I am currently studying at my dream school - TUES.</p>
                <p>I have been interested in technology since I was 3 years old. I still remember myself using my dad's computer running Windows XP. Playing music on YouTube and playing games.</p>
                <p>When I got my first tablet in 1st grade, I was probably the happiest kid alive. It was not anything special, it was a non-branded Chinese tablet for $50 from the local hypermarket. That was the moment I touched modern technology. I have made my first Google Account which me and my cousin were using.</p>
                <p>Since I was 7, I thought that I do not need a PC and the future is portable. Well, I was both right and wrong. I still believe the future will be mobile, but we have not reached that point, yet!</p>
                <p>But in 2016 I returned to my roots. I got the old XP machine from my father, And I decided that I want to study at TUES, and I want to become a programmer. I started disassembling my PC, installing different OSes.</p>
                <p>In 2017 2 big things happened: I made my Bulgarian YouTube channel and I bought my first PC (yes, a pre-build which I made into a beast).</p>
                <p>And 2018/2019 were the most important years. I started studying even harder. Most of my family did not believe me, because I was not the best in literature. But I showed them that they were wrong by getting 89.5/100 in Literature and 95 on my favorite subject - Math.</p>
                <p>And now in 2020, I have graduated 8the grade with GPA 4.0 (6/6) at TUES. And I know it is going to get harder every year, but I am ready to fight everything. And win at the end! Because the most important thing in the world is to:</p>
